# Malware-Classification-using-Machine-Learning-with-Graphs

The following is the code implementation of [Learning Discriminative Representations for Malware Family Classification](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-27409-1_121).

## Introduction
In this research, we used Machine Learning on Graphs methods namely Graph2Vec and GL2Vec to generate expressive low-dimensional vectors of malware behavior graphs. These vectors, which capture the different structural properties of the behavior graphs, are then used for downstream classification task.

## Dataset
From the [Malrec Dataset](https://giantpanda.gtisc.gatech.edu/malrec/dataset/), we collected 7000 malware samples from 14 differ-ent families (500 malware per family). We confirmed their assigned families by majority voting between the antivirus software correctly identifying the samples as malicious.

## Method
We parse malware system call traces and generate behavior graphs based on their data dependency.
