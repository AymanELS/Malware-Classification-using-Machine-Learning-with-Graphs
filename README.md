# Malware-Classification-using-Machine-Learning-with-Graphs

The following is the code implementation of [Learning Discriminative Representations for Malware Family Classification](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-27409-1_121).

## Introduction
In this research, we used Machine Learning on Graphs methods namely Graph2Vec and GL2Vec to generate expressive low-dimensional vectors of malware behavior graphs. These vectors, which capture the different structural properties of the behavior graphs, are then used for downstream classification task.

## Dataset
We used the Malrec Dataset
